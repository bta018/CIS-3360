# CIS-3360
## This C program reads a text file, then calculates a checksum based on a specified bit size (8, 16, or 32 bits), and outputs the checksum. It supports padding the data when needed to ensure it's a multiple of 16 or 32 bits.
##
## The core functions:
##    Read the file content.
##    Pad the content if required.
##    Calculate the checksum using one of three methods (8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit checksum).
##    Print the contents and checksum results.
